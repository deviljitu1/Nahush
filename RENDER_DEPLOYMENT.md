This guide will help you deploy the LinkedIn AI Post Generator to Render, making it accessible to anyone on the internet.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. A Render account (free tier available)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your repository contains these files:
- `app.py` - Flask web application
- `index.html` - Main web interface
- `style.css` - Styling
- `script.js` - Frontend JavaScript
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `render.yaml` - Render configuration

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Render

### Option A: Using render.yaml (Recommended)

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Click "New +" and select "Blueprint"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
5. Click "Apply" to deploy

### Option B: Manual Deployment

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `linkedin-ai-post-generator`
   - **Environment**: `Python`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Health Check Path**: `/health`

5. Add Environment Variables:

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

In your Render dashboard, go to your service and add these environment variables:
